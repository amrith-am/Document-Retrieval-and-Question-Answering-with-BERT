# Document-Retrieval-and-Question-Answering-with-BERT

In first part of this repository we developed, with 2 different techniques, a Document Retrieval System, which aims to return titles of scientific
papers containing the answer to a given user question. 

Note that our dataset is the initial-first release of CORD-19 dataset, 2020-03-13, which is the smallest possible dataset with 9000 articles.
