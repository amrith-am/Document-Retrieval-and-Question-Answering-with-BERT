# Document-Retrieval-and-Question-Answering-with-BERT

In first part of this repository we developed, with 2 different techniques, a Document Retrieval System, which aims to return titles of scientific
papers containing the answer to a given user question. 

For example, for the question “What are the coronaviruses?”, your system can return the
paper title “Distinct Roles for Sialoside and Protein Receptors in Coronavirus Infection”
since this paper contains the answer to the asked question.

To achieve the goal of this exercise, you will need first to read the paper Sentence-BERT:
[Sentence Embeddings using Siamese BERT-Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.10084.pdf), in order to understand how you
can create sentence embeddings.

Note that our dataset is the initial-first release of CORD-19 dataset, 2020-03-13, which is the smallest possible dataset with 9000 articles.
