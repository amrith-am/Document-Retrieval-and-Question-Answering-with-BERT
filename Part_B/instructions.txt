We encourage you to read our notebooks with the above order:

1) BertFineTuning_1-3 
   >In this notebook you can observe our model's training section for epochs 1-3.
  
2) BertFineTuning_4-6 
   >In this notebook you can observe our model's training section for epochs 4-6.

3) BertEvaluation 
   >In this notebook you can observe our model's evaluation section, in which we
    give three examples so as to check it's behavior.

4) CompareWithBertFineTunedSQuAD
   >Copy of BertEvaluation notebook, with the basic difference that in this notebook 
    you can observe 'bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad' model's 
    evaluation, in order to compare our model's answers with a more accurate and 
    complicated pretrained model.
